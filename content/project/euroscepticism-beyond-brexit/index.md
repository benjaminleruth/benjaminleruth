Ever since [the start of my academic career](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/16175), I have been focusing on issues surrounding patterns of opposition to European integration. While most of my publications relate to party-based Euroscepticism (see below), I have been increasingly interested in studying transnational and pan-European patterns of opposition and their implications for the future of European integration. 

Following the United Kingdom's departure of the European Union in 2020 and as the EU keeps on facing multiple challenges following a decade of 'polycrisis', these transnational and pan-European dynamics are likely to shift. 

The publications below investigate how these dynamics have evolved over time.
