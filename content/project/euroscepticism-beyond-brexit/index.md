Ever since [the start of my academic career](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/16175), I have been interested in issues surrounding patterns of opposition to European integration and how these are connected to preferences for differentiation in the European Union. While most of my publications focus on political parties at the national level, I have been increasingly interested in studying transnational and pan-European patterns of opposition and their implications for the future of European integration. 

Following the United Kingdom's departure of the European Union in 2020 and as the EU keeps on facing multiple challenges following a decade of 'polycrisis', these transnational and pan-European dynamics are likely to shift. Furthermore, as Brexit constitutes a ground-breaking case of differentiated *dis*integration in the European Union, my research focuses on whether this will become a genuine model of disintegration that can be used by 'hard' Eurosceptic parties.

The publications below investigate how these dynamics have evolved over time.
