The COVID-19 pandemic came at the end of a decade of social, economic, and political crises for Europe. It stalled economic recovery and affected democratic politics and governance throughout the continent, calling for institutional transformation at various levels. The EU-funded REGROUP project will provide the EU with actionable advice on how to rebuild post-pandemic governance and public policies in an effective and democratic way. It will do so based on an analysis of the socio-political consequences of the pandemic, and an empirically-informed normative evaluation of it. Bringing together a consortium of 14 institutions, the project aims to achieve a high degree of policy, societal, and scientific impact.
