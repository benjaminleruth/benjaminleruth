Welfare chauvinism, populism and Euroscepticism all have major implications for the future of social policy. Yet, the causes and most importantly the consequences of their increasing popularity and implementation remain understudied. Factors such as the nature of crises, the type of welfare regime and the type of policy targeted (e.g. contrasting healthcare with unemployment benefits) are yet to be investigated. The project therefore addresses how welfare chauvinism, populism and Euroscepticism affect general understandings, perceptions, attitudes and policies of welfare.
