Welcome to my website. I am an Assistant Professor in Politics and Society at the University of Groningen specializing in comparative welfare policy and politics, political long-termism, democratic innovations, transnational governance and differentiation in the European Union. 

At the University of Groningen, I act as Programme Coordinator for the [BA in European Languages and Cultures](https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/european-languages-and-cultures/?lang=en), and as Theme Director on Democracy and Governance within the transdisciplinary [Research School for Sustainable Development](https://www.rug.nl/sustainable-society). Since August 2022 I am the Chair of the [Young Academy Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/research/young-academy/?lang=en). 

I am also co-Editor-in-Chief of [Acta Politica](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/journal/41269).

Between 2022 and 2025, I am deputy scientific coordinator and Work Package leader within the Horizon Europe-funded project entitled "[Rebuilding Governance and Resilience out of the Pandemic](https://regroup-horizon.eu/)" (REGROUP), in which we will (among others) conduct mini-publics on trust and disinformation. 

I recently published work focusing on: 

1. [How differentiation serves as a vehicle for the long-term sustainability and institutional robustness of the EU](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcms.13404); 
2. [How innovative task environments might stimulate citizens' political efficac](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tpp/pap/2020/00000048/00000003/art00001;jsessionid=3ijmtu3d2egbq.x-ic-live-01)[y](https://uia.brage.unit.no/uia-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2686741/Trondal10084.pdf?sequence=1);
3. [How citizens think of and support welfare policies in the long term](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-75783-4).
