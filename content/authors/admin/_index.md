Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal website. I am a Senior Lecturer in Public Policy at the University of Melbourne specializing in comparative welfare policy and politics, political long-termism, democratic innovations, transnational governance and differentiation.

I am currently working on three research projects. 

The first one, "Exploring Political Long-Termism" (funded by the Dutch Research Council), aims at understanding what motivates citizens to favour policies that might be costly in the near future but deliver benefits in the long run. 

The second project, entitled "[Rebuilding Governance and Resilience out of the Pandemic](https://regroup-horizon.eu/)" (REGROUP), focuses on learning policy lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic, and I lead a Work Package in which we conduct a transnational, multi-level citizens' jury on citizens' attitudes towards pandemic governance. You can read more about this in my [Methodological Brief](https://zenodo.org/record/8082723), which elaborates on the multi-level deliberative design we seek to implement. 

The third project focuses on patterns of welfare state opposition, with a particular focus on welfare Euroscepticism.

I am also co-Editor-in-Chief of [Acta Politica](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/journal/41269).

I recently published work focusing on: 

1. [How differentiation serves as a vehicle for the long-term sustainability and institutional robustness of the EU](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcms.13404); 
2. [How innovative task environments might stimulate citizens' political efficac](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tpp/pap/2020/00000048/00000003/art00001;jsessionid=3ijmtu3d2egbq.x-ic-live-01)[y](https://uia.brage.unit.no/uia-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2686741/Trondal10084.pdf?sequence=1);
3. [How citizens think of and support welfare policies in the long term](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-75783-4).
