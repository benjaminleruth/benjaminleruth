Welcome to my website. I am an Assistant Professor in European Politics and Society at the University of Groningen specializing in comparative politics and welfare policy, Euroscepticism, democratic innovations, and differentiation in the European Union.

At the University of Groningen, I also act as Programme Coordinator for the [BA in European Languages and Cultures](https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/european-languages-and-cultures/?lang=en), and as Coordinator for the university-wide [Research Network on Democracy and Governance](https://www.rug.nl/sustainable-society/research/democracy-and-governance). 

I recently published work focusing on: 

1. [Whether differentiation is a response to crises in the European Union](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/differentiation-response-crises-benjamin-leruth/e/10.4324/9781003001423-12); 
2. [How innovative task environments might stimulate citizens' political efficac](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tpp/pap/2020/00000048/00000003/art00001;jsessionid=3ijmtu3d2egbq.x-ic-live-01)[y;](https://uia.brage.unit.no/uia-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2686741/Trondal10084.pdf?sequence=1)
3. [Why transnational party families are becoming less relevant when it comes to shaping party positions towards European integration](https://uia.brage.unit.no/uia-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2686741/Trondal10084.pdf?sequence=1).
