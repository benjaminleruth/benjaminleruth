Over the past ten years, I have been designing introductory and specialised courses on a wide range of topics and aimed at different audiences, from first-year undergraduate students to Australian public servants. I am also a regular contributor to the University of Agder's [European Integration Summer School](https://www.uia.no/en/studier/european-integration-summer-school-eiss).
